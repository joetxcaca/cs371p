Paper #11: More getters and setters
remember to go to Perusall THROUGH Canvas
*/

/*
Takeaways:

 1. assertions are not good for testing
 2. assertions are not good for user errors
 3. don't use equality on floating point
 4. prefer pre-increment
 5. always catch by reference
 6. built-in stack arrays are always passed by address
 7. built-in stack arrays are DO NOT know their size
 8. built-in stack arrays are NOT comparable
 9. built-in stack arrays are NOT copyable
10. built-in stack arrays are NOT assignable
11. std::array<> DOES know its size
12. std::array<> IS comparable
13. std::array<> IS copyable
14. std::array<> IS assignable
12. std::array<> is to a built-in array as std::string is to a built-in char array
13. built-in heap arrays are always passed by address
14. built-in heap arrays are DO NOT know their size
15. built-in heap arrays are NOT comparable
16. built-in heap arrays are NOT copyable
17. built-in heap arrays are NOT assignable
18. built-in heap arrays are NOT resizable
19. std::vector<> DOES know its size
20. std::vector<> IS comparable
21. std::vector<> IS copyable
22. std::vector<> IS assignable
23. std::vector<> IS resizable
24. std::vector<> is to a built-in heap array as std::array is to a built-in stack array
25. std::vector<> resizing will invalidate old iterators, pointers, and references
26. use member initialization list to avoid unwanted default constructor call
27. use const_cast for reuse
28. use explicit to turn off implicit type conversion
