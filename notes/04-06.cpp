Cold Calling
	you're only called ONCE per rotation
	it's totally fine to not know the answer, the idea is to discuss and to learn

Notes
	these notes will be posted on GitLab

Canvas
	personal questions
	please message all 3 of us

Ed Discussion (EdStem), replaces Piazza
	class questions
	ask and answer questions
	please be proactive

GitLab, like GitHub, do a git clone, later git pull, on	 a regular basis
	notes
	examples
	exercises

HackerRank, competitive programming platform
	exercises

Perusall, collaborative annotation tool (you must go through the Canvas assignment)
	annotate a series of papers
	the first one will be the syllabus

Zoom
	5.9.6
	must use UT EID credentials (@eid.utexas.edu)
	classes recorded
	published later that day

Takeaways:

 1. assertions are not good for testing
 2. assertions are not good for user errors
 3. don't use equality on floating point
 4. prefer pre-increment
 5. always catch by reference
 6. built-in stack arrays are always passed by address
 7. built-in stack arrays are DO NOT know their size
 8. built-in stack arrays are NOT comparable
 9. built-in stack arrays are NOT copyable
10. built-in stack arrays are NOT assignable
11. std::array<> DOES know its size
12. std::array<> IS comparable
13. std::array<> IS copyable
14. std::array<> IS assignable
12. std::array<> is to a built-in array as std::string is to a built-in char array
13. built-in heap arrays are always passed by address
14. built-in heap arrays are DO NOT know their size
15. built-in heap arrays are NOT comparable
16. built-in heap arrays are NOT copyable
17. built-in heap arrays are NOT assignable
18. built-in heap arrays are NOT resizable
19. std::vector<> DOES know its size
20. std::vector<> IS comparable
21. std::vector<> IS copyable
22. std::vector<> IS assignable
23. std::vector<> IS resizable
24. std::vector<> is to a built-in heap array as std::array is to a built-in stack array
25. std::vector<> resizing will invalidate old iterators, pointers, and references
